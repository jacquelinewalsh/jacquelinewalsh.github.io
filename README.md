#Background and Interests
Here is where I’ll put an introduction that tells people about who I am, what I’m studying, and what my goals are for the future.

You can make this section as brief or as expansive as you’d like, and if you want to can also include links to a resume or other accomplishments, though that is not necessary to complete this particular assignment.

#White House Salaries
This is an example of what a summary section would look like. Here is a project that took White House salary data and created a dashboard to compare who got the highest raises.

See the page in action here.

#Biden Transition Tracking
This project scraped the Biden Transition site and captured what was new, then generated a dynamic report that can be updated multiple times a day as necessary to share information on the status of the transition teams.

See the report here.
