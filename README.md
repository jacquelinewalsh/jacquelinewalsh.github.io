#Background and Interests
I am currently a senior at The George Washington University studying Communication and Journalism. After I finish my undergraduate degree in the next few weeks, I am hoping to be admitted to Northwestern's Sports Journalism Masters program for Fall 2021. I am eager to apply the data journalism expertise I have developed over this semester through this course in my future journalism endeveours involving sports. 

#White House Salaries 
Here is a project from an assignment this semester that took White House salary data and created a dashboard to compare who got the highest raises.

See the page in action here.

#Biden Transition Tracking
This project scraped the Biden Transition site and captured what was new, then generated a dynamic report that can be updated multiple times a day as necessary to share information on the status of the transition teams.

See the report here.
